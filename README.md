## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Deck of Cards API

## Optimizations:

Refactored the API calls from promises to async/await, and I plan to add player avatars, card tracking, and a twist to the game that allows cards to be 'raided' from the other player.

## Lessons Learned:

Building this project made me much more comfortable with the syntax, and creating the functionality from basic documentation was a great excercise in critical thinking and testing different approaches to solving problems.
